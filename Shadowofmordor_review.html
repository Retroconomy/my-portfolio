    <section>
        <h2>Story and Themes</h2>
        <p>
            The narrative explores revenge, power, and identity. Talion’s quest for vengeance is intertwined with Celebrimbor’s struggle against Sauron, creating a dual narrative that adds depth to the story.
          </p>

      <!-- Combat system Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>Combat System</h2>
        <p>
            The combat in Shadow of Mordor takes heavy inspiration from the Arkham series, featuring fluid, combo-based melee mechanics that feel visceral and rewarding. Players control Talion, a Gondorian ranger bonded with the wraith of Celebrimbor, the elven smith who forged the Rings of Power. This bond grants Talion supernatural abilities, combining traditional swordplay with ghostly powers for a unique blend of action.
            <p>Core Fighting Features:</p>
                <p>Swordplay:</p>
                <p>Players can chain attacks, parry enemy blows, and execute finishing moves with precision. As enemies attack in waves, the combat encourages a rhythm-like flow, rewarding players who maintain their combos and manage multiple enemies effectively.</p>
                <p>Archery (Wraith Bow):</p>
                <p>Celebrimbor’s powers allow Talion to slow time momentarily while aiming, enabling precision shots to decapitate or cripple enemies. This system makes ranged combat strategic and impactful, rather than a secondary option.</p>
                <p>Stealth Mechanics:</p>
                <p>Talion can silently dispatch enemies with brutal stealth kills or terrify foes using wraith abilities. Stealth is not just an option but often a necessity when infiltrating heavily guarded enemy strongholds.</p>
                    <p>Execution Moves and Skills:</p>
                        <p>As players progress, they unlock new abilities like shadow strikes (teleporting to distant foes) and brutal executions. These moves keep combat fresh and add a strategic layer to battles, especially against tougher captains.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #D4AF37; font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">The Nemesis System</h2>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          At the heart of <strong>Shadow of Mordor</strong> lies the Nemesis system, an innovative mechanic that creates dynamic, evolving rivalries between the player and enemy orcs. This system ensures no two playthroughs are alike, as every interaction with the enemy army feels personal and impactful.
        </p>
      
        <h3 style="color: #D4AF37; font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; margin-bottom: 10px;">How It Works</h3>
      
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <strong>Procedural Generation:</strong> Each orc captain and warlord is procedurally generated, resulting in unique personalities, traits, and appearances. These enemies have strengths (like immunity to stealth or ranged attacks) and weaknesses (like fear of fire or beasts) that players must exploit.
        </p>
      
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <strong>Memory and Revenge:</strong> Orcs remember previous encounters with Talion. If a captain defeats the player in battle, they grow stronger, often taunting the player when they meet again. Similarly, if an orc survives an encounter but escapes or is scarred, they will hold a grudge and may return more dangerous than before. This creates an ongoing, personal narrative between Talion and the enemy.
        </p>
      
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <strong>Hierarchy:</strong> The orc army has a hierarchical structure, with grunts, captains, and warlords. Killing or sparing a captain has ripple effects, as it opens opportunities for power struggles among the remaining ranks. Players can exploit these rivalries to weaken the orc army from within.
        </p>
      
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <strong>Domination Mechanic:</strong> Later in the game, Talion gains the ability to dominate orcs, turning them into allies. This mechanic transforms the Nemesis system into a strategy game, as players can infiltrate or manipulate the hierarchy by promoting their dominated orcs to higher ranks.
        </p>
      
        <h3 style="color: #D4AF37; font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; margin-bottom: 10px;">Development of the Nemesis System</h3>
      
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          Monolith Productions spent years perfecting the Nemesis system, leveraging procedural generation and advanced AI algorithms to make every orc feel distinct. The system tracks player interactions, victory conditions, and even minor details like how an orc was injured in combat, ensuring that each enemy feels alive and reactive.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Legacy of the Nemesis System:</strong>The Nemesis system was groundbreaking, becoming the defining feature of Shadow of Mordor. It not only elevated the game above its peers but also set a new standard for player-driven storytelling. Despite its success, few games have adopted similar systems, partly due to the complexity of implementation and Monolith’s patent on the technology. </p>

       <!-- Legacy Section -->
    <section>
        <p>
            Shadow of Mordor was praised for its innovation, with the Nemesis system becoming a hallmark of its legacy. It laid the foundation for its sequel, Shadow of War, and influenced game design across the industry.
